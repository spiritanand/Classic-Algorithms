# Classic-Algorithms
The following are included in my program :-

1.Collatz Conjecture - A number n > 1. Returns the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: 

If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.


2.Sieve of Eratosthenes - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).


3.Sorting - Implementing two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

## PEACE.
